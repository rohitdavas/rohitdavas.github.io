# Online Education 

I pursue my interests benefiting from the open source education from MIT OCW, standford etc. and Coursera. A list of courses with certifications can be found on [linkedin/certificates](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohitdavas/details/certifications/). The course ranges in Neurosciences, Deep learning, Reinforcement learning, computer vision and the courses on the methods of learning. 

Apart from them I would thank to Gilbert Strang's course on Linear Algebra, Andrew Ng's CS229, CS231n and various others. 
A list of courses that interests me : 
- Neuroscience : Synapse, Neuron and Brain from Hebrew University; Computationa neuroscience from University of Washignton. 
- Robotics: Pursuing Introduction to Mobile Robotics and Robot Mapping from Autonome Intelligente Systeme. Pursuing Robotics Specilisation from Coursera.
- Machine Learning: Completed Deep learning specilisation: Convolutional Neural Networks, Improving Deep Neural Networks, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Sequence Models, Structuring Machine Learning Projects on Coursera, Fundamentals Of Reinforcement Learning, Sample Based Learning Methods, AI for medical diagnosis, Machine learning. Audited Stanfordâ€™s cs229-Machine Learning, and cs230-Deep learning
- Others: Pursuing OSSU data science track Algorithms Part 1. Completed Learning how to learn
