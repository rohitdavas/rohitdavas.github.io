## Hi there, 
This repository is the knowledge that I acquired on my own through learning from online free courses provided by various Institutes like Coursera, Stanford, MIT, University of Torranto, University of Berkeley. 

This Repo will consist of assignments, study materials, Research Papers.

You can get this on <a href = "https://github.com/rohitdavas/Self_Learning" target="_blank"> Self Learning Github Repository</a>

## Purpose of this Repo :
 - I will be making New repo probably by the name of _knowledge matters_ , target of which is to collect all the free good courses in _Deep Learning_, _Robotics_, _Machine Learning_ and many others and _provide a guide on how one should learn them from beginner to expert using multiple free courses provided by Stanford, Coursera, MIT & other universities. 
 - to help out the people who wants to learn, learn in a sequenced way.
 - You can look at my assignments if you are stuck somewhere.


## List of my Learning :
-  **Deeplearning.ai DeepLearning Specialisation**
   - Course 1 : Neural Networks & Deep Learning
   - Course 2 : Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
   - Course 3 : Structuring Machine Learning Projects
   - Course 4 : Convolutional Neural Networks
   - Course 5 : Sequence Models

-  **CS230 Stanford : Deep Learning**
    > At stanford, CS230 is the deeplearning Course currently taken by Andrew Ng. 
    >
    > Flipped class version accompanies deeplearning.ai's DeepLearning Specialisation.
    >
    > (Find more inside the CS230 Stanford folder)

-  **Deeplearning.ai TensorFlow in Practice Specialization**
    -Course 1 : Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning 

-  **CS229 Stanford : Machine Learning**
-  **CS231n Stanford : Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition**
-  **Research Papers**
    - Convolutional Neural Networks 
    > This contains the research papers that I have studied.
    >
    > All the papers are well read by me, and we can share our knowledge by discussing them
