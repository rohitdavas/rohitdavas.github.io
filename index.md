## Timeline

- (January, 2022 - Ongoing ) AI Software developer at Captury GmbH where i contribute on dataset preparations, handpose tracking, CPython bindings, build process, plugin management for unreal and unity, building prototypes using unreal engine, unity and oculus quest etc. My role mostly involves developing things from scratch. 

- ( May, 2021 ) - I graduated in 4 year long undegraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Jammu. 

- (July - December, 2021) I am working as freelancer for Captury GmbH after my completion of graduation. This is the time I started building handpose tracking support for Captury.

- ( October - December, 2020) I am working as Deep Learning and Computer vision intern with Captury GmbH. I am working on Fast Background subtraction using neural networks. 

- ( May 2020 - May, 2021 ) I am working on location privacy and reinforcement learning methods for it in colaboration with Prof. Isao Echizen, NII Japan and Dr. Harkeerat Kaur, IIT Jammu. This colaboration led to successful publication of two papers mentioned below. [publications section](#publications)

- ( May - July, (Summer) 2020 ) I am working as summer intern with Captury GmbH. I successfuly built the "End to End 3D face landmarks annotation". My work on "Facial expression transfer via morph-key prediction" led to another long term project in company.  

- ( September - December, 2019 ) I am the Cultural Secretary of IIT Jammu. A major contribution from me was the start of Student Mentorship Program for the incoming batches and passing of significant budgets for cultural clubs and fest. 

- ( July 22 - July 31, 2019 ) : led a team of 30 members to organize a 10 day long foundation programme at IIT Jammu. [news and report](https://iitjammu.ac.in/post/foundation-program) 

- ( May - July, (Summer) 2019) : Summer research at IIT Bombay, working with Prof. Virendra Singh, on the topic of object detection and deep learning methods for it.
