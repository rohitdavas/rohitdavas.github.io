<!-- ## Introduction -->
I am a Final year student of BTech in Computer Science And Engineering ( 2017-21 ) at [IIT Jammu](https://iitjammu.ac.in/).
Most of my work is centered around the AI and it's applications in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, applications in medicine, Robotics. 
With time, I am getting more and more interested in Neuroscience, but haven't done much in this yet. Feel free to contact!

## Experience

- Intern in Computer Vision and Deep Learning at [The Captury, Germany](http://thecaptury.com/), Summer'20
- Research Intern at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) under [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/), Summer'19 

## Research Paper
