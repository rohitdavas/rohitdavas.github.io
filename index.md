## Introduction

I am a 3rd year student of B.Tech in Computer Science with Departmental Specilization in AI, batch 2017-21 at [IIT Jammu](https://iitjammu.ac.in/).\\
Most of my work is centred around the AI and it's applications in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, applications in medicine. With time, I am getting more interested in Neuroscience, but haven't done much in this yet. 

## Internships

1. I am an Intern in Computer Vision and Deep Learning at [The Captury, Germany](http://thecaptury.com/), Summer'20
1. I was a research Intern at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) under [Prof. Virendra Singh], Summer'19
