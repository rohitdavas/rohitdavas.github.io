<!-- ## Introduction -->
I am a Final year student of BTech in Computer Science And Engineering ( 2017-21 ) at [IIT Jammu](https://iitjammu.ac.in/).\\
Most of my work is centered around the AI and it's applications in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, applications in medicine. With time, I am getting more and more interested in Neuroscience, but haven't done much in this yet. 

## Internships

1. I am an Intern in Computer Vision and Deep Learning at [The Captury, Germany](http://thecaptury.com/), Summer'20
1. I was a research Intern at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) under [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/), Summer'19 

## Research Paper

Paper 1: Smart data agent for preserving location privacy accepted for publication in IEEE SSCI'20

## Major Projects

- Working on developing a deep learning model for Fast Background Subtraction. 
- Developed Automatic 3D human face landmarks annotation pipeline for [The Captury](https://captury.com/)
- Developed a deep learning model Face Expression Transfer via shape key/ morph key prediction  for [The Captury](https://captury.com/)
  - Classical approach results can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uA78oCkMkEz8hkRawuLq6v3ygjMEkBF/view) 

## Side Projects and Achievements

- **Optimization** : Silver in Bosch’s Route Optimization problem in Inter-IIT Tech Meet’19 

- **Sentiment Analysis** 3rd Rank among 20 teams in *Innovate for IIT Hackathon* organized by PRITHVI.AI ( Nov’19 ) 
- **Robotics** Rank in Mazex- maze solving bot during Technunctus’19, IIT Jammu.
- **Drones** 9th among 23 IIT's in PlutoX hackathon in Inter-IIT Tech Meet’18  
- I have also worked with Neural Style Transfer; object detection; GANs; segmentation; visual odometry; depth maps; Text generation; Music generation; etc.
