### Timeline

- (January, 2022 - Ongoing ) AI Software developer at Captury GmbH where i contribute on dataset preparations, handpose tracking, CPython bindings, build process, plugin management for unreal and unity, building prototypes using unreal engine, unity and oculus quest etc. My role mostly involves developing things from scratch. 

- ( May, 2021 ) - I graduated in 4 year long undegraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Jammu. 

- (July - December, 2021) I am working as freelancer for Captury GmbH after my completion of graduation. This is the time I started building handpose tracking support for Captury.

- ( October - December, 2020) I am working as Deep Learning and Computer vision intern with Captury GmbH. I am working on Fast Background subtraction using neural networks. 

- ( May 2020 - May, 2021 ) I am working on location privacy and reinforcement learning methods for it in colaboration with Prof. Isao Echizen, NII Japan and Dr. Harkeerat Kaur, IIT Jammu. This colaboration led to successful publication of two papers mentioned below. [publications section](#publications)

- ( May - July, (Summer) 2020 ) I am working as summer intern with Captury GmbH. I successfuly built the "End to End 3D face landmarks annotation". My work on "Facial expression transfer via morph-key prediction" led to another long term project in company.  

- ( September - December, 2019 ) I am the Cultural Secretary of IIT Jammu. A major contribution from me was the start of Student Mentorship Program for the incoming batches and passing of significant budgets for cultural clubs and fest. 

- ( July 22 - July 31, 2019 ) : led a team of 30 members to organize a 10 day long foundation programme at IIT Jammu. [news and report](https://iitjammu.ac.in/post/foundation-program) 

- ( May - July, (Summer) 2019) : Summer research at IIT Bombay, working with Prof. Virendra Singh, on the topic of object detection and deep learning methods for it.

## Experiences 

###  Captury Summer 2020 - . 
I work as AI software developer. Major part of my job role involes developing neural network as well as the data needed for it. The other part of my job involes developing prototypes on the AI technology we develop at Captury. Captury works in realtime markerless motion capture system - [read more](https://captury.com). I develop various prototypes in unreal, unity and for oculus quest. I contribute in C++, C and Python towards the core software also and the plugins needed for the 3D simulation software. I extensively work with blender and it's python API to generate the synthetic datasets. I developed the python library for Captury using C-API's of CPython, that provides user access to internal implementation of captury. This enabled captury for the first time to scale the Shot processing on server farms. I also developed the hand tracking technology. 

I have been working on and off with Captury since summer of 2020 and joined them as full time in January 2022. 

### Undergradaute 2017 - 2021 
I pursued my bachelors in Computer Science and engineering from Indian Institute of Technology ( IIT ), Jammu, India. It is one of the presitigious insitute in India. During my time there, I participated in various inter IIT tech meets, and held leadership position multiple time, the most significant of which was as Cultural secretaory. 

I collaborated with Professors for work in AI. A result of which led to successful publications, term papers and various semester projects. I am immensly grateful to professors there for their teaching. To Dr. Harkeerat Kaur for her guidance in research and for Prof. Sumit Kumar Pandey for his guidance during hard times and for carrer.
